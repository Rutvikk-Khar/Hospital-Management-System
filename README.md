**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**
The project is a team-based learning experience focused on developing skills as effective team players in a software project. Its goal is to create a comprehensive and efficient Hospital Data Management system, serving as a Database Management System (DBMS) solution. The system handles medical records, staff information, departments, patient and doctor unique IDs, diseases, treatments, admission details, room allocation, and management of ward boys and nurses. It aims to provide easy data accessibility, organization, and retrieval to support hospital operations and facilitate routine and emergency visits.

**ESTIMATED DATA VOLUMES**

The data volume would depend on the scale of the application and the number of doctors, patients, appointments, and invoices. As an estimate, for a small to medium-sized clinic, you have hundreds to thousands of records in each table, which is well within the capacity of modern databases. However, for larger healthcare systems or hospitals, the data volume could be significantly larger, potentially reaching millions of records. In such cases, the database infrastructure needs to be appropriately scaled and optimized for efficient data management and retrieval.
